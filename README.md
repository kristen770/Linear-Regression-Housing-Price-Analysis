# Project Overview  
This project uses a modified version of King County House Sale data. The project comprised of two major parts: EDA & building a linear regression model. This data includes housing price, data sold, county house condition and grade rating, longitude & latitude points & number of bedrooms and bathrooms among other columns. I was specifically intersted in the homes being sold that fell on the low end of this spectrum (i.e. low quality, less expensive houses.)


# Business Problem  
In an effort to increase access to quality affordable housing, keep people rooted in their neighborhoods and fight the effect of over development King County and Habitat for Humanity are creating a public private initiative aimed at making data driven decisions to inform house acquisition and repairs in the greater Seattle area.  

# EDA  
Given the defined buisness problem I wanted to focus my EDA and define a narrow window exploration that would lead to strong data insights and analysis. 

## Question 1: What is the distribution of housing grade in the data? 
The majoritiy of houses in this data set are in the "average" grade range (7/8) there is a larger distribution of houses on the high end of the grading scale (9-13) than on the lower end (0-6). houses with a grade of 3 or 13 could be identified as outliers.

# Linear Regressions 

# Conclusions  
Based on this analysis my stake holders, King County and Habitat for Humanity, should look at houses that are at or below the minimum grade in housing condition and/or grade in zipcodes such as 98168 to buy or select for renovation projects. When renovating or updating houses they should focus on improving the overall house's grade and increasing sq footage where possible to increase the house's price. 

# Future Work 
1. Explore new data - the King County Website has extensive housing data [here](https://info.kingcounty.gov/assessor/DataDownload/default.aspx) I would dig into and see how it could enhance the data I already have 
2. A/B Testing - Look at the effect of an additional bedroom or bathroom on price, preform similar A/B testing on varying grades & condition scores
3. Model Refinement - Continue to iterate over OLS model, consider new features to engineer and other ways of preparring the data. 
4. Geographic Considerations - Map demographic information with folium or use the lat/ lon data points in other meaningful ways.
