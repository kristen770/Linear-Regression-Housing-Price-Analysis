# Project Overview  
This project uses a modified version of King County House Sale data. The project comprised of two major parts: EDA & building a linear regression model. This data includes housing price, data sold, county house condition and grade rating, longitude & latitude points & number of bedrooms and bathrooms among other columns. I was specifically intersted in the homes being sold that fell on the low end of this spectrum (i.e. low quality, less expensive houses.)


# Business Problem  
In an effort to increase access to quality affordable housing, keep people rooted in their neighborhoods and fight the effect of over development King County and Habitat for Humanity are creating a public private initiative aimed at making data driven decisions to inform house acquisition and repairs in the greater Seattle area.  

# EDA  
Given the defined buisness problem I wanted to focus my EDA and define a narrow window exploration that would lead to strong data insights and analysis. 

## Question 1: What is the distribution of housing grade in the data? 
The majoritiy of houses in this data set are in the "average" grade range (7/8) there is a larger distribution of houses on the high end of the grading scale (9-13) than on the lower end (0-6). houses with a grade of 3 or 13 could be identified as outliers.
